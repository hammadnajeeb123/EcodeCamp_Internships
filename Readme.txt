# Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. The model achieves a **95% accuracy** rate, making it a powerful tool for early detection and diagnosis.

## Datasets
The project utilizes the Breast Cancer Prediction Data Set, which includes various features measured from breast cancer samples.

## Machine Learning Models
- **Linear Regression**: Used to predict continuous outcomes.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification of cancerous vs. non-cancerous samples.

## Data Pre-processing
Data was scaled and processed to improve model performance. Techniques such as normalization and handling missing values were applied.

## Model Training
The models were trained using cross-validation to ensure robustness and prevent overfitting.

## Results
The final model achieved a **95% accuracy** in predicting breast cancer, demonstrating its effectiveness.
