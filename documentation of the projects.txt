project no 2 : Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

Summary:

This Python script performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive or negative. It utilizes the Kaggle API to download a sentiment dataset ("sentiment140"), performs data cleaning and preprocessing, trains a Logistic Regression model, and evaluates its accuracy. Finally, it saves the trained model for future predictions.

Code Breakdown (within 300 words):

Kaggle API Setup (Lines 1-6):

Sets up the Kaggle API by creating a directory (~/.kaggle) and copying your Kaggle API token (kaggle.json) to it (replace these lines with your actual setup).
Downloads the sentiment140 dataset using !kaggle datasets download -d kazanova/sentiment140.
Extracts the downloaded ZIP file using zipfile.
Data Loading and Preprocessing (Lines 7-46):

Loads the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame (twitter_data).
Corrects column names (column_names) for proper reading.
Checks for missing values (twitter_data.isnull().sum()).
Examines the distribution of target values (positive/negative tweets) using value_counts().
Replaces target labels (0 and 4) with binary values (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
Defines a stemming function to process text:
Removes non-alphabetical characters and converts to lowercase.
Splits words and applies stemming using PorterStemmer.
Removes stop words (common words like "the", "a") and joins stemmed words back into a string.
Applies stemming to the "text" column and stores the result in a new column "stemmed_content".
Data Splitting and Feature Engineering (Lines 47-62):

Separates features (text content - "stemmed_content") and target labels ("target") into separate variables (x and y).
Splits data into training and testing sets using train_test_split. Stratification ensures proportional class distribution in both sets.
Prints shapes of datasets to verify splitting.
Model Training (Lines 63-68):

Creates a TF-IDF vectorizer (TfidfVectorizer) to convert text data into numerical features.
Transforms training and testing data using the fitted vectorizer (vectorizer.fit_transform).
Logistic Regression Model (Lines 69-76):

Creates a Logistic Regression model (LogisticRegression) with a maximum of 1000 iterations.
Trains the model on the transformed training data (model.fit(x_train,y_train)).
Model Evaluation (Lines 77-86):

Calculates accuracy scores for both training and testing data using accuracy_score.
Prints the accuracy scores to evaluate model performance.
Model Saving (Lines 87-90):

Uses pickle to save the trained model as "trained_model.sav".
Prediction with Saved Model (Lines 91-102):

Loads the saved model using pickle.load.
Selects a sample tweet from the test set for prediction (x_new).
Predicts the sentiment of the sample tweet using the model (model.predict(x_new)).
Interprets the prediction (0: negative, 1: positive) and prints the sentiment.
What You Learned:

You learned how to use the Kaggle API to download datasets for analysis.
You explored data cleaning and preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, label encoding, and text stemming.
You grasped the concept of TF-IDF vectorization to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning models.
You implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify text sentiment.
You evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and learned to save models for future use.
Note:

Replace the Kaggle API setup lines with your actual configuration.
This code provides a basic example. Consider exploring more advanced techniques like hyperparameter tuning and other machine learning models for sentiment analysis tasks.



Purpose:

This Python script is designed to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive or negative. It utilizes the Kaggle API to download a sentiment dataset ("sentiment140"), performs data cleaning and preprocessing, trains a Logistic Regression model, and evaluates its accuracy. Finally, it saves the trained model for future predictions.

Methodology:

Data Acquisition:

The Kaggle API is used to download the "sentiment140" dataset, which contains labeled tweets with sentiment polarity.
Data Preprocessing:

The downloaded data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Column names are corrected to ensure accurate interpretation.
Missing values are checked and handled (if necessary).
The target labels are converted to binary values (0: negative, 1: positive) for consistency.
Text data is preprocessed using stemming to reduce words to their root form, removing stop words (common words like "the", "a") and handling non-alphabetical characters.
Feature Engineering:

The preprocessed text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. This technique assigns weights to words based on their frequency and importance within the corpus.
Model Training:

A Logistic Regression model is trained on the vectorized training data. This model is suitable for binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model's performance is evaluated on the testing data using accuracy score. This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified tweets.
Model Saving:

The trained model is saved for future use, allowing for predictions on new, unseen data.
Code Structure:

The code is organized into the following sections:

Data Acquisition: Downloads the dataset using the Kaggle API.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Converts text data into numerical features.
Model Training: Trains the Logistic Regression model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance.
Model Saving: Saves the trained model for future use.
Key Libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
numpy: For numerical operations.
re: For regular expressions used in text preprocessing.
nltk: Natural Language Toolkit for stemming and stop word removal.
sklearn: Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks, including TF-IDF vectorization, logistic regression, and model evaluation.
Applications:

Sentiment Analysis: Can be used to analyze public opinion on various topics, brands, or products.
Social Media Monitoring: Helps track sentiment trends and identify potential issues or opportunities.
Customer Feedback Analysis: Can be used to understand customer satisfaction and identify areas for improvement.
Limitations:

Sentiment Complexity: Sentiment analysis can be challenging due to nuances in language, sarcasm, and context.
Data Quality: The accuracy of the model depends on the quality and quantity of the training data.
Model Limitations: Logistic Regression may not capture complex relationships in the data, especially for highly nuanced sentiment analysis.
Further Improvements:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different parameters in the Logistic Regression model to optimize performance.
Ensemble Methods: Consider using ensemble techniques like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.
Deep Learning: Explore deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers for more complex text understanding.
Contextual Understanding: Incorporate contextual information (e.g., time, location) to improve sentiment analysis accuracy
