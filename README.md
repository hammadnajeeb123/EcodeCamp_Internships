"""Breast Cancer Prediction with Logistic Regression

This script predicts breast cancer (benign or malignant) using a Logistic Regression model trained on a dataset (replace 'breast cancer pridiction data set.csv' with the actual Kaggle dataset name) obtained from Kaggle.

**Note:** This script provides a basic example. For real-world applications, consider more comprehensive data preparation, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation techniques.

**Libraries:**

- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- seaborn: Data visualization
- matplotlib.pyplot: Basic plotting
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
    - LabelEncoder: Categorical to numerical encoding
    - train_test_split: Train-test data splitting
    - StandardScaler: Feature scaling
    - LogisticRegression: Classification model
    - classification_report: Model evaluation metrics

**Sample Data (replace with actual data loading):**

data = {'radius_mean': [13.0, 17.0, 18.0, 12.0, 15.0, 11.0, 14.0, 15.0, 10.0, 16.0],
        'texture_mean': [21.0, 25.0, 16.0, 20.0, 23.0, 17.0, 18.0, 20.0, 13.0, 22.0],

        'diagnosis': ['M', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'B', 'M', 'B', 'M']}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
Use code with caution.

Data Preparation:

Python
# Convert 'diagnosis' column to numerical values (0: Benign, 1: Malignant)
lb = LabelEncoder()
df['diagnosis'] = lb.fit_transform(df['diagnosis'])

# Split data into features (X) and target variable (y)
X = df.drop(columns=['diagnosis'])
y = df['diagnosis']

# Train-test split
X_train, X

Data Preparation:

Load Data: The script starts by loading a dataset containing breast cancer information. Replace the placeholder "breast cancer pridiction data set.csv" with the actual filename of your dataset.
Preprocess Data: The code handles missing values using forward fill (ffill) and converts categorical columns (like "diagnosis") into numerical values using pd.factorize.
Visualize Data: It creates a pair plot to visualize relationships between features and a count plot to analyze the distribution of a random column (optional).
Model Building and Evaluation:

Split Data: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Create Model: A logistic regression model is created and trained on the training data.
Evaluate Model: The model's performance is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
Prediction with User Input (Optional):

The script allows you to input new data and get predictions from the trained model.

Key Purposes:

Breast Cancer Prediction: The primary purpose of this code is to predict whether a person has benign or malignant breast cancer based on their features.
Medical Decision Support: The model can be used as a tool to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions about patient treatment.
Research and Analysis: The code can be used for further research into breast cancer prediction and the relationship between features and diagnosis.
Potential Improvements:

Feature Engineering: Consider creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different regularization parameters (C) and other model settings to optimize accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Use additional metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for a more comprehensive evaluation.
Visualization: Explore other visualization techniques to gain deeper insights into the data and model behavior.

project no 2 : Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression

Summary:

This Python script performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive or negative. It utilizes the Kaggle API to download a sentiment dataset ("sentiment140"), performs data cleaning and preprocessing, trains a Logistic Regression model, and evaluates its accuracy. Finally, it saves the trained model for future predictions.

Code Breakdown (within 300 words):

Kaggle API Setup (Lines 1-6):

Sets up the Kaggle API by creating a directory (~/.kaggle) and copying your Kaggle API token (kaggle.json) to it (replace these lines with your actual setup).
Downloads the sentiment140 dataset using !kaggle datasets download -d kazanova/sentiment140.
Extracts the downloaded ZIP file using zipfile.
Data Loading and Preprocessing (Lines 7-46):

Loads the CSV data into a Pandas DataFrame (twitter_data).
Corrects column names (column_names) for proper reading.
Checks for missing values (twitter_data.isnull().sum()).
Examines the distribution of target values (positive/negative tweets) using value_counts().
Replaces target labels (0 and 4) with binary values (0 for negative, 1 for positive).
Defines a stemming function to process text:
Removes non-alphabetical characters and converts to lowercase.
Splits words and applies stemming using PorterStemmer.
Removes stop words (common words like "the", "a") and joins stemmed words back into a string.
Applies stemming to the "text" column and stores the result in a new column "stemmed_content".
Data Splitting and Feature Engineering (Lines 47-62):

Separates features (text content - "stemmed_content") and target labels ("target") into separate variables (x and y).
Splits data into training and testing sets using train_test_split. Stratification ensures proportional class distribution in both sets.
Prints shapes of datasets to verify splitting.
Model Training (Lines 63-68):

Creates a TF-IDF vectorizer (TfidfVectorizer) to convert text data into numerical features.
Transforms training and testing data using the fitted vectorizer (vectorizer.fit_transform).
Logistic Regression Model (Lines 69-76):

Creates a Logistic Regression model (LogisticRegression) with a maximum of 1000 iterations.
Trains the model on the transformed training data (model.fit(x_train,y_train)).
Model Evaluation (Lines 77-86):

Calculates accuracy scores for both training and testing data using accuracy_score.
Prints the accuracy scores to evaluate model performance.
Model Saving (Lines 87-90):

Uses pickle to save the trained model as "trained_model.sav".
Prediction with Saved Model (Lines 91-102):

Loads the saved model using pickle.load.
Selects a sample tweet from the test set for prediction (x_new).
Predicts the sentiment of the sample tweet using the model (model.predict(x_new)).
Interprets the prediction (0: negative, 1: positive) and prints the sentiment.
What You Learned:

You learned how to use the Kaggle API to download datasets for analysis.
You explored data cleaning and preprocessing techniques like handling missing values, label encoding, and text stemming.

Purpose:

This Python script is designed to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data, classifying tweets as positive or negative. It utilizes the Kaggle API to download a sentiment dataset ("sentiment140"), performs data cleaning and preprocessing, trains a Logistic Regression model, and evaluates its accuracy. Finally, it saves the trained model for future predictions.

Methodology:

Data Acquisition:

The Kaggle API is used to download the "sentiment140" dataset, which contains labeled tweets with sentiment polarity.
Data Preprocessing:

The downloaded data is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
Column names are corrected to ensure accurate interpretation.
Missing values are checked and handled (if necessary).
The target labels are converted to binary values (0: negative, 1: positive) for consistency.
Text data is preprocessed using stemming to reduce words to their root form, removing stop words (common words like "the", "a") and handling non-alphabetical characters.
Feature Engineering:

The preprocessed text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization. This technique assigns weights to words based on their frequency and importance within the corpus.
Model Training:

A Logistic Regression model is trained on the vectorized training data. This model is suitable for binary classification tasks like sentiment analysis.
Model Evaluation:

The trained model's performance is evaluated on the testing data using accuracy score. This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified tweets.
